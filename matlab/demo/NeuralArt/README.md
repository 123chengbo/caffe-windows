A Caffe Implementation of Neural Art
============

Based on paper
> A Neural Algorthm of Artistic Style' by Leon Gatys, Alexander Ecker, and Matthias Bethge (http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).

The model used here is VGG-16. I have thinned the net model with only conv layer paramters retaining. The thinned model can 
be downloaded from http://pan.baidu.com/s/1kT8d3Iv .

Usage
===========
I exploited this on my laptop and it's too slow to tune the parameters to be the best. The performance is not very good right now. However, you can still try it.
