A caffe implementation of Neural Art
============

Based on paper
> A Neural Algorthm of Artistic Style' by Leon Gatys, Alexander Ecker, and Matthias Bethge (http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).

The model used here is VGG-16. I have thinned the net model with only conv layer paramters retaining. The thinned model can 
be downloaded from http://pan.baidu.com/s/1kT8d3Iv .
